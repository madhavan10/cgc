        <p>Classical Guitar Calendar was founded by Bogdan Mihailescu and Madhavan Somanathan. Both professional classical guitarists they had the idea of creating a platform for classical guitar events in 2016 while studying in Paris. After some time spent learning website coding followed by proper work building it, in 2021 they have released the first version of the website. </p>
        <p>CGC is aiming to create a community around all the guitar events and is conceived to reduce the time a person has to spend searching for their perfect festival, competition or workshop. </p>
        <p>We are looking forward to know about your event. </p>
